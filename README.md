# cyclistic-case-study
This is a case study for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

## Business task
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy annual memberships?

## Data sources
User data from the past 12 months, November 2021 - October 2022 has been made available. Each data set is in csv format and details every ride logged by Cyclistic customers.
